## Overview of the Project  

**Project:** LED Blinking with Arduino  

**Objective:**  
The objective of this project was to program an Arduino to blink an LED at a 1-second interval. This task introduced basic embedded programming concepts and hardware interfacing.  

---

## Key Activities  

- **LED Integration:** Connected the built-in LED on the Arduino (Pin 13) to test the blinking functionality.  
- **Code Development:** Created a simple Arduino sketch to control the LED using GPIO commands.  
- **Testing:** Verified the blinking pattern with accurate timing intervals.  
- **Troubleshooting:** Ensured consistent performance and corrected any timing or functionality issues.
